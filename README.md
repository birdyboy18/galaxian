#Galaxian

Galaxian is a take on the classic space shoot-em up. I went for a face paced feel. Try and survice the onslaught of enemies as you tackle wave after wave of alien ships. Can you survive?

## How it was made

I didn't really like the code we were given, therefore I remade the game by following the tutorial and editing as I wanted needed. You can find the Blog Post series I followed [here]("http://blog.sklambert.com/html5-canvas-game-panning-a-background/")

## Controls

Controls for the game are simple. use all the arrow keys to move around and spacebar to shoot lots of awesome lasers and stuff!

## Features

- Laser Sounds
- Explosion Sounds
- Background Music
- Parallax background
- Fast Frame Rates
- Scoring
- Increased Flock / Wave Speed
- Scoring Board (Is implemented, but not working)
- Move in 4 directions
- Shoots two bullets at a time
- Pause Menu
- GameOver Screen

## Things I wanted to do but never got time

- Particle Effects
- Get the highscores working
- Adding in a shield
- Weapon configurations

### Overview

I've found making the game extremely fun, and will properly look into doing more of html / javascript canvas stuff in the future. Next time I think I might use a pre-built game library though. Just to save me all the work.
