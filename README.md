#Galaxian

Galaxian is a take on the classic space shoot-em up. I went for a face paced feel. Try and survice the onslaught of enemies as you tackle wave after wave of alien ships. Can you survive?

## Handin

All the files have been handed in on a USB Stick, but it's also all up on this github repo. To view the flowchart, you'll find it is called galaxian-flow-chart.png and no flowchart.png (ignore that).
Here is a [link to it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birdyboy18/galaxian/master/galaxian-flow-chart.png)

## How it was made

I didn't really like the code we were given, therefore I remade the game by following a tutorial online and editing it as I wanted / needed. You can find the Blog Post series I followed [here](http://blog.sklambert.com/html5-canvas-game-panning-a-background/ "Link to start of tutorial series")

Controls for the game are simple. use all the arrow keys to move around and spacebar to shoot lots of awesome lasers and stuff!

### Overview

I've found making the game extremely fun, and will properly look into doing more of html / javascript canvas stuff in the future. Next time I think I might use a pre-built game library though. Just to save me all the work.
