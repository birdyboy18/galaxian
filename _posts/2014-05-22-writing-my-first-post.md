Well, here it goes my first post that i'm writing in markdown and then 
converting into text and html thanks to the powers of Jekyll an awesome static site generator

<p>Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into  little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her  head. 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make  SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must  make me smaller, I suppose.'</p>

<p>So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she  began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through  the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little  animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was  in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it  something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she  appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself  safe in a thick wood.</p>

'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered  about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second  thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be  the best plan.'

<p>It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply  arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea  how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among  the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a  great hurry.</p>

<p>An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and  feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'  said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but  she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be  hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of  all her coaxing.</p>

<p>Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and  held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off  all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,  and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,  to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the  other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head  over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was  very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every  moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then  the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very  little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely  all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with  its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</p>

<p>This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she  set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and  till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.</p>

<p>'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant  against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the  leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if&mdash;if I'd  only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that  I've got to grow up again! Let me see&mdash;how IS it to be managed? I  suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great  question is, what?'</p>

<p>The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at  the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that  looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.  There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as  herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and  behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what  was on the top of it.</p>

<p>She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the  mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,  that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long  hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.</p>
