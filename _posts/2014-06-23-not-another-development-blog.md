Hello, just a few quick words to say here and that is the purpose of this blog. This blog is really more for a personal reason. I know that our marking lecturers love blogs as they are a chronological listing of the 'what' and 'how' of our thoughts.

This blog is hosted on the gh-pages of the entire project, so this site is version controlled and is built by Jekyll which is a static site generator. It's really cool and I can write it in markdown or html it doesn't really matter, it's just static files at the end of the day. No logins, no hassle.

# The purpose of this blog

The true purpose of this blog is simply to document my understanding of making a sapce invaders-esque game in javascript. It's worth noting that I am developing this from scratch by following a tutorial and then editing where needed, these are the things that I will be documenting the small things I've changed that are not in the tutorial.
